rapel-client.vim
============

Rapel client will connect to a Rapel REPL server so that expressions can be
sent and results are received.

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/domgetter/vim-rapel-client.git
